blurb: Rob is a veteran practitioner of open sourcery in NHS-land. Iconoclastic, bombastic, almost EHI Healthcare IT Champion (2013). He's developed innovative products, successfuly navigated procurements, formed (unlikely) alliances, written award bids winning Â£ms for NHS orgs from tech/nursing/challenge funds, and survived the benign and benevolent effects of support from 'the centre'. Just. He requires little food, lots of coffee, has a photographic memory, and knows where many a skeleton is buried.
