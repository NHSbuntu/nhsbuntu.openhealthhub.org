blurb: Brett's passion is solving big scary problems.  He is most at home working on the moonshot projects leading or delivering transformational change to organisations and users.  He has an extensive background in delivery of large scale critical services but remains a techie at heart.  Knows a bit too much about riding bikes irresponsibly.
