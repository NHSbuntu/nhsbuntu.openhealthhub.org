blurb:Kenny has been working in Health Tech since 1999 with a main focus on Primary Care IT. His first hack was whilst he was still in the Navy as a Communications/Messaging specialist when his boss caught him playing Prince of Persia on a 16ft display screen used for Navigation training (Windows didn't exist then)! He is passionate about delivery of technology that provides ease of use to the front line practitioner. He worked closely with Microsoft during the NHS EWA years and was involved in the Primary Healthcare specialist group (Which is where he met Rob). Latterly, his focus has been on CyberSecurity and the education of the Front line user of Health tech.
